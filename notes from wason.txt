updates:


built a functional model, crashed any simulation, seemed to timeout, mad slow,
this was about 2 days before I talked to Will last,

since then, I've rebuilt the module, a little more minimally, 
really only the node and a wrapper for the RRSharedPtr

Should be done by the end of the weekend, then on to testing, and mapping
godot object feedback through the RR objects

so I pared down what is exposed to godot,
so instead of calling from godot, things are 
called only from the module

or a server - model godot's physics engine, or
gd script parser

effort command, have a robot controller
implement the actual torques


setup a request queue on the godot side, based
for threadding timing issues.


use the servo for the standard robdefs
to test the RR Godot stuff


Look at the gazebo module for RR for how these should be used

John Wason


all datatypes are standardized throughout godot

add vr stuff
